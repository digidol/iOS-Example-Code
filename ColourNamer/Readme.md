Colour Namer
============
This application includes two views. The first view includes three UISlider objects, which are used to adjust the colour of the background. For a particular colour, a name can be set and displayed at the top of the screen. To set the name, a second view is shown.

This is the version of the application that is built on the course. It does not remember the name. It uses the Exit feature of the Segues in Storyboards to clear the second view from the screen.
