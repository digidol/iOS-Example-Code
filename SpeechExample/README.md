SpeechExample 
=============
This project demonstrates the use of the new AVSpeechSynthesis features in iOS 7. The 
AVFoundation framework has been enhanced to add support for programmatic control over 
reading out text. 

This example focuses on the use of the AVSpeechSynthesisVoice and AVSpeechUtterance 
classes. The GUI provides some controls to manage the volume, language, pitch and rate 
of the text. You can enter your own phrase to be read out and click on the Say It button. 

The application is built using the Single View application template.
